## Description

Please describe your issue in as much detail as necessary for us to understand it. Please
create **one GitHub issue for each problem you experience**. Otherwise it is hard to track
the progress.

## Expected behavior

## Actual behavior

<!-- 
If you intend to provide error messages, try to format them in a code block.
To make troubleshooting easier (unless the issue is easy to reproduce), the verbose output
of Install-Lab -Verbose will also be helpful in a code block.
-->

## Steps to reproduce

```powershell
#Please add all PowerShell Code necessary to reproduce your issue here.
```

## Environment details

Ideally, if you can: Upload a support package. ***Be warned, this may contain PII and confidential information***. If
in doubt, have a look at it first.
Support packages can be generated in the same PowerShell session you experience an error in with `New-PSFSupportPackage -Include All`

The support package allows us to retrieve all errors as well as all verbose messages, regardless of whether you have
used the Verbose parameter or not.
